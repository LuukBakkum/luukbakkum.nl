1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.

2. Update the following files with your information:

   - [`.github/workflows/main.yml`](./.github/workflows/main.yml): Update the workflow to add your
     own domain
   - [`public/CNAME`](./public/CNAME): Update the CNAME record to your own domain
   - [`public/robots.txt`](./public/robots.txt): Update the Robots.txt record
   - [`public/site.webmanifest`](./public/site.webmanifest): Update the webmanifest
   - [`public/sitemap.xml`](./public/sitemap.xml): Update the static sitemap
   - [`src/config`](./src/config/): Update the configuration variables
   - [`src/i18n/languages.ts`](./src/i18n/languages.ts): Update the needed languages
   - [`package.json`](./package.json): Change the name, description, and author
   - [`index.html`](./index.html): Update the meta tags

3. Customizing styles:

   - [`src/styles/_variables.css`](./src/styles/_variables.scss): Update SCSS variables

4. Customizing content:

   - [`public/locales`](./public/locales): Update the i18n JSON locale files to match your wanted
     content.
     > ðŸ’¡ if you change the structure of the locale files, make sure this is reflected inside the
     > associated component(s). Most of the time this is done automatically

5. Setting up EmailJS and Mailgun:

   - Sign up for an [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) account
   - Sign up for a [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) account
   - Create a new EmailJS service connected to your Mailgun account
   - In your EmailJS dashboard, create a new email template
   - Copy your EmailJS User ID and Email Template ID
   - Setup
     [Cloudflare Email Routing](https://www.cloudflare.com/nl-nl/developer-platform/email-routing/)
     for redirections to your personal Gmail address
   - Update the [`.env`](./.env) file with your EmailJS credentials (see step 6)

6. Environment variables:

   - Copy [`.env.example`](./.env.example) to [`.env`](./.env) and update the values as needed

7. Hosting Setup: You have two main options for hosting your site:

   a) Custom Domain with Cloudflare (Recommended Setup):

   1. Purchase a domain from a registrar like [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/).
   2. Set up a [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) account and add your site:
      - Log in to Cloudflare and click "Add a Site"
      - Enter your domain name and click "Add Site"
      - Select the Free plan and continue
   3. Update nameservers at your domain registrar:
      - Cloudflare will provide you with nameservers
      - Log in to your Namecheap account and go to your domain's settings
      - Replace the existing nameservers with the ones provided by Cloudflare
   4. Configure Cloudflare DNS:
      - In Cloudflare, go to the DNS section
      - Add the appropriate records from
        [Managing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)
   5. Enable HTTPS in Cloudflare:
      - Go to the SSL/TLS section and set SSL/TLS encryption mode to "Full"
   6. Update your GitHub repository:
      - Ensure your custom domain is set in the CNAME file in the `public` directory
      - Update the GitHub Actions workflow file to deploy to your custom domain
      - In your repository settings, under "Pages", ensure your custom domain is set

   b) GitHub Pages URL: If you prefer to use the default GitHub Pages URL
   (username.github.io/repo-name):

   > ðŸ’¡ Note: I haven't tested this approach yet

   - Remove or update the CNAME file in the [`public`](./public) directory
   - Update the `homepage` field in `package.json` to match your GitHub Pages URL
   - Modify the GitHub Actions workflow file to remove custom domain configuration
   - Update any absolute URLs in your code to be relative paths

   > ðŸ’¡ Note: The current configuration is set up for a custom domain with Cloudflare. If you
   > successfully set up the site with a different configuration, please consider contributing
   > documentation of the process to help future users.

   Further Reading:

   - [GitHub Pages Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)
   - [Namecheap Domain Setup with Cloudflare](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9607/2210/how-to-set-up-dns-records-for-your-domain-in-cloudflare-account/)

Remember to test your site thoroughly after making these changes to ensure everything works as
expected with your chosen hosting setup. DNS changes can take some time to propagate, so be patient
if your site doesn't work immediately after making changes.

## Architecture

### Folder Architecture

This project follows a
[colocated](https://medium.com/trabe/colocating-react-component-files-the-tools-you-need-c377a61382d3)
component-based architecture. The most noteable files are listed below:

```python
.github/
â””â”€â”€ workflows
    â””â”€â”€ main.yml    # GitHub Actions workflow (CI/CD Pipeline)

public/
â”œâ”€â”€ fonts/          # Font files
â”œâ”€â”€ locales/        # Internationalization locales
â”œâ”€â”€ resume/         # Resume PDF files
â””â”€â”€ CNAME           # CNAME record pointing to your custom URL

src/
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/         # Assets that are not globally used
â”œâ”€â”€ components/     # Components that are not page-specific
â”œâ”€â”€ config/         # Configuration files and asset mappings
â”œâ”€â”€ contexts/       # Context definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/          # Custom hooks
â”œâ”€â”€ i18n/           # Internationalization configuration files
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/          # Top-level page-specific components
â”œâ”€â”€ providers/      # Context providers
â”œâ”€â”€ routes/         # Routing configurations
â”œâ”€â”€ skeletons/      # Skeleton components
â”œâ”€â”€ styles/         # Global SCSS styling
â”œâ”€â”€ types/          # General/global types
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/          # Utility functions and helper methods
â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx
â””â”€â”€ main.tsx

.env.example        # Example environment variables
.eslintrc.cjs       # ESLint configuration
.prettierrc         # Prettier configuration
index.html          # Entry point, SEO values for static scrapers are defined here
package.json        # Packages
vite.config.ts      # Vite (build tool) configuration
```

Components (including page components) are
[colocated](https://medium.com/trabe/colocating-react-component-files-the-tools-you-need-c377a61382d3)
and thus structured in the following way:

```python
Component/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts                  # Provides default export gateway; see below
â”œâ”€â”€ Component.module.scss     # SCSS module with component-specific styling
â””â”€â”€ Component.tsx             # Main component
```

> ðŸ’¡ Note: index.ts provides a gateway to the default export of the `Component.tsx` component. Which
> makes the following syntax possible:

```ts
// Without index.ts
import Component from ./Component/Component

// With index.ts
import Component from ./Component
```

### Email Architecture

The chosen email architecture provides a way of fully obfuscating your personal email address
through an email address on your personal domain (in my case `hello@semplaatsman.nl`). This email
architecture provides 100 emails through your contact page a month (or 200 without Auto-Reply
Emails) for free, and 100 emails a day through your personal email inbox. Below is the diagram:

![Email Architecture Diagram](./docs/assets/Email%20Architecture.webp)

This process can be divided into **8 steps**:

1. Sender sends an email from your contact page.
2. Email is sent from your contact page to EmailJS servers.
3. EmailJS sends a submission email to your custom email address (in my case
   `hello@semplaatsman.nl`).
4. Cloudflare Email Routing routes the email to your personal inbox.
5. EmailJS sends an Auto-Reply email to your Mailgun service.
6. Mailgun sends an Auto-Reply email as your custom email address (`hello@semplaatsman.nl`) to the
   sender.
7. If you wish to get back to a message from the Sender, you can send an email as your custom email
   address (`hello@semplaatsman.nl`) from your personal inbox through Mailgun (See
   [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21649085/18598382)).
8. Mailgun sends your email back to the Sender.

### Hosting Architecture

This project uses a combination of GitHub Pages, Cloudflare, and Namecheap to host and serve the
website. The hosting process can be divided into several key components:

1. **GitHub Pages**: Hosts the actual website files and serves them.

   - The repository's `main` branch is set up to build it's code and push it to the `gh-pages`
     branch. This branch is then served to a custom domain.

2. **Namecheap**: Acts as the domain registrar.

   - The custom domain (e.g., semplaatsman.nl) is purchased and managed through Namecheap.

3. **Cloudflare**: Serves as a CDN, DNS manager, and provides additional features.
   - DNS Management: Cloudflare manages the DNS records, pointing the custom domain to GitHub Pages.
   - CDN: Caches the website content globally for faster access.
   - SSL: Provides free SSL certificate for HTTPS.

This architecture provides several benefits:

- Free hosting through GitHub Pages
- Global content delivery and improved performance via Cloudflare's CDN
- DDoS protection, and other security features from Cloudflare
- Easy SSL setup for HTTPS
- Simplified deployment process through GitHub Actions

For detailed setup instructions, refer to the
[Configuration and Customization](#configuration-and-customization) section of this README.

## CI/CD

This project uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Deployment:

- **Continuous Integration**: On every pull request to `main`, GitHub Actions runs linting, (in the
  future tests), and tries to successfully build the application to ensure code quality.
- **Continuous Deployment**: When changes are merged to the `main` branch, the application is
  automatically built and deployed to GitHub Pages.

You can find the workflow configuration in
[`.github/workflows/main.yml`](.github/workflows/main.yml).

## Contributing
